### Note from Luna

This fork only contains the files for my own versions of the closed captions.<br>
Much hasn't been changed, I only changed some of the captions for medic and the class colors.

I also fixed some captions cutting off due to some weirdness with the ``<B>`` tag

``clovervidia_medic`` contains added captions for classes yelling ``MEDIC!``
